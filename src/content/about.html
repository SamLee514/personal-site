      I'm currently a software development engineer at AWS on the Amazon Connect team in NYC. I mostly work on backend services relating to authentication and session management.
      I graduated from Vanderbilt University in 2022 with majors in Computer Science, Math and French Horn Performance.

      My interests include Olympic weightlifting, online shopping, listening to the 2010 London Cast Recording of Les Mis√©rables, ducking the Oxford comma and
      cooking brussels sprouts. I also recently started getting into volleyball.
