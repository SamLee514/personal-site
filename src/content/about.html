        <p>I am currently a senior at Vanderbilt University triple majoring in Computer Science, Mathematics and French Horn Performance. Last summer, I worked as a fullstack intern at Intuit. I am currently an AI engineer at LMI Technologies, as well as the tech lead for VandyHacks, Vanderbilt's student-run hackathon planning org.</p>

        <p>My interests include software engineering, web-based systems and machine learning.</p>

        <p>Outside of the nerd stuff, I enjoy weightlifting, listening to the 25th Anniversary Live Cast Recording of Les Mis√©rables, ducking the Oxford comma and making the world's juiciest avocado toast.</p>
