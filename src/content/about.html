      I graduated from Vanderbilt University in May 2022 with majors in Computer
      Science, Math and French Horn Performance. My interests include full stack
      web development, machine learning and really any new technology that I
      haven't gotten around to exploring yet. While in school, I worked as a
      software engineering intern at Intuit, an AI R&D engineer at LMI
      Technologies and the tech lead for VandyHacks, Vanderbilt's student-run
      hackathon planning org.

      Due to recent market conditions, my offer to start work at
      <a href="https://www.usekojo.com/">Kojo</a> in July has fallen through, so
      I'm currently seeking out new opportunities (see Figure 1).

      Outside of the nerd stuff, I enjoy weightlifting, listening to the 25th
      Anniversary Live Cast Recording of Les Mis√©rables, ducking the Oxford
      comma and making the world's juiciest avocado toast.
