        <h3>Morsel</h3>

        <p>
            A CLI tool to play around with and practice Morse code. I'd been wanting to jump on the Rust hype train for a while and this turned out to be a quick and fun intro to the language. 
            The concept was fairly straightforward: short and long key-presses correspond to dots and dashes in Morse code; Morse code lends itself well to being represented 
            as a tree (although in hindsight a {morse_sequence : character} map would probably have been easier). Surprisingly, the most difficult part was interpretting keystrokes. As the terminal 
            doesn't differentiate between a long key-press and a series of very quick taps, and different machine have different delays between when a key is first pressed and when repeating 
            keys beging to be registered, there were quite a few considerations to be made.

            The judging platform for VandyHacks, Vanderbilt's annual hackathon. This is a recent effort to streamline and unify our judging process, creating a smoother
            experience both our judges and our hackers. The scope of this project includes managing project submissions, automating assignments between judges and hackers and 
            collecting judges' feedback. More to come soon!

        <p>
            Promotional website for VandyHacks VII: Retro Edition. This was super fun to make, especially as it was such a fun concept and my first project using a tool like 
            React. Given the theme of our event, we wanted our website to incorporate elements of retro arcade games. I was able to work closely with our design team 
            and implement a site that I think does that quite well, while still placing an emphasis on accessibility and user experience (see: Turbo Mode).

            A website for the Vanderbilt University Microbiome Society. This originated as a group project for our Principles of Software Engineering course, where we 
            sought out clients for whom to build a project. The site was to serve as marketing material for the organization, as well as a Khan-Academy-esque repository of microbiome-related 
            educational content. My contributions were mainly in implementing the backend API for the educational content and setting up our CI/CD process. While we were able to
            get much of the groundwork done by the end of the semester, this is still a work-in-progress as we move toward making the site deployable and maintainable by the members of the organization
            going forward.

        <h3>Transfer Learning Autoencoders</h3>
    </span>
    <div>
        <img src="/assets/images/autoencoder.png" alt="Transfer Learning Autoencoders" width="200"/>
        <p>
            A brief experiment exploring the viability of pretrained UNet-like image segmentation models as autoencoders for defect detection tasks. The goal of an autoencoder network
            is to learn important features from an input such that said input can be compressed and reconstructed as close to the original as possible. The reasoning behind using such
            networks for defect detection is that, when trained on images of "good" data, an autoencoder network will not be able to reconstruct any defects in a "bad" image (it should 
            effectively have compressed those away). Taking a residual between inputs and outputs can thus isolate the defective area if it exists. This experiment's purpose was to see if
            image segmentation networks that look like autoencoders can function as such, and if so, if pretraining those networks provide any benefit.
