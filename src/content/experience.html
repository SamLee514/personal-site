        This past summer, I had the pleasure of interning at Intuit as part of the Small Business Group Sales Tax team. My project was to develop
        a fullstack feature that would allow Quickbooks Online users to set a separate accounting basis for each of their tax agencies, thus allowing them more
        granular control over how they calculate their sales tax.

        I joined FringeAI in July 2020 as my first proper internship. Since then, I have been able to do a lot of interesting work, including developing
        a defect detection modeling pipeline, implementing state-of-the-art deep learning models and introducing performance improvements at upwards of
        2 times throughput in deployed services.

        In Summer 2020, I participated in the Vanderbilt Data Science Institute's Summer Research Program as part of the Palmeri Lab. My work
        was in investigating how individual differences in visual object recognition among instances of neural networks could reflect similar
        differences in humans, as well as the causes that give rise to those differences.

        Throughout both semesters of my sophomore year at Vanderbilt, I had the honor to be an undergraduate grader for CS2201: Data Structures. I was able
        to familiarize myself with the course's material at a level much deeper than from simply taking the class, and was also able to contribute some code to
        the grading scripts.
