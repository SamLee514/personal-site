# Startups vs. Big Tech for New Grads

<strong id="viewsAndDate">views | June 26, 2022</strong>

---

I had my startup offer rescinded a couple weeks after graduating college. Now, with just a month to go before my original start date, I needed a new gig. Fortunately, I had built up a reasonable network in the past few years and senioritis hadn’t completely claimed my final semester, so I still had some interviewing skills. After two weeks of frantic job hunting, I had offers on the table again. Most from startups, one from AWS. So things ended up all right and I made it out of my harrowing time as a [NEET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEET). Only now I had to ask myself a fundamental question:

How do I _actually_ want to start my career?

More specifically, do I want to go with a startup or a big tech company? For the last twelve months, I had pretty much taken for granted that startups were the way to go. After all, I’m probably the most risk tolerant I’ll ever be in my career, I was fortunate enough to graduate debt-free and joining a rocket ship team just seemed like the cooler thing to do. To say nothing of the learning and growth you pretty much have to go through just to stop everything from being on fire all the time. And if I were to try to start a venture of my own down the line, surely being part of someone else’s startup would have the highest utility. Right?

I’d love to definitively say yes or no here but all my deliberating happened over a single weekend. Also, to date, I have spent exactly 0 days living out the consequences of my decision. Now, before I go any further, I’ll say I did end up going with AWS. For the rest of this post, I’m going to be laying out my own rationale, as well as some of the advice I got from friends and family who are a lot more qualified to be talking about this than I am. At the end of the day, I’d like to reiterate that I’m just some kid on the internet talking out of my ass. If you’d like to skip that and read some actual advice, I’ve linked some of my references [below](#references).

## Contention #1: The Upside

_If working at a startup goes well, it might go really really well. If you join early enough in a company and really lean into the equity package, you might be setting yourself up to become a multimillionaire in just a few years. You could potentially be ready to retire by the time your pre-med friends from college are ready to figure out what to spend the next half-decade of their education specializing in (I have pre-med friends so I’m allowed to make that joke). Plus, you will have built something incredible and fulfilling, and that could be worth more to you than any amount of money._

&nbsp;

Perhaps, but the chances you’ll make it big at a startup are shockingly slim. Every founder wants you to believe they’ve built a rocket ship. By definition, most of them are wrong. Even the ones with VC funding are still probably wrong, as venture capitalists back more failed startups than truly successful ones. If the startup does happen to be a rocket ship, you’re probably riding in steerage. Dilution, liquidation preferences and other investment shenanigans could mean your 0.5% stake in the company will be a lot less in a few years. A startup could give you a detailed calculator showing you exactly what you will be worth in 4 years if the company is valued at 1x, 2x, or 10x its current valuation (i.e. rich, super rich, Batman). The company doesn’t show you what happens if the market takes a hit and you suddenly have 0x anything because “at-will employment” really does mean either party can renege at any time (cough cough).

Plus, if you’re in it only for the financial upside, you could always just buy yourself a first class ticket and [invest](https://carta.com/equity/learn/invest-in-startups/).

## Contention #2: Risk Tolerance

_But that’s part of the risk! No thinking person joins a startup without realizing that it’s a risk. And if no one took these risks, we wouldn’t have any nice things. If things go badly, that’s fine. You probably don’t have much to lose, at least compared to where you’d otherwise be a decade or more into your career. There’s probably no family or social circle that’s depending on you right now to make a consistent income, so you can afford to bet that your paltry equity share will someday be worth millions and toss out any notion of work life balance. If your first job ends because the entire company went underwater, that’s ok. Dust yourself off and try again._

&nbsp;

Sure, I agree with that. I drank the Kool-Aid, it bit me in the ass, and I was preparing to do it again because the consequences weren’t that bad the first time. But one thing I forgot to factor in was what the impact would be on my career down the line.

Suppose I take a stable junior dev role at BigTechCorp. After a few years of playing the corporate game, I’ve got a good shot of making senior engineer (or at least SDE 2). If I decide to tap out then, I can pretty much go wherever I want. Everyone will know I’m capable enough to not only make it through the door at BigTechCorp but also do good work there at a high level. On top of that, I’ll have developed an unshakeable skillset to back up the pedigree by working on systems at the largest scale with some of the best engineers in the industry.

Contrast that with what happens if I join a startup, even one that ends up moderately successful. Unless I actually walk out of a unicorn, the fact is that BigTechCorp is the bigger draw by far. It’s an automatic foot in the door nearly everywhere. A startup that does pretty well is still a startup that most people have never heard of. Now, if I had started at BigTechCorp and joined a failing-to-middling startup afterward, that’s fine. I just happened to take a calculated risk that didn’t work out the way I expected. I’m still an alum of BigTechCorp and my foot is still in many doors. If I didn’t take the BigTechCorp job first, I’ll dust myself off and still just be some schmuck someone has to take a chance on.

## Contention #3: Experience and Learning Potential

_Okay, but if you’re so interested in startups, perhaps even wanting to start your own someday, isn’t the best thing for you right now to just work at startups? You’ll learn a lot, even beyond just engineering. A lot of people who have worked at both startups and big tech will tell you they learned more in their time at a startup. You’ll see how a business scales from nothing into something (depending on the size of the startup), and you’ll probably have some say in how it goes about doing that. Every startup interviewer will tell you that you will be asked to wear many hats (which is nice for someone fresh out of school who might not know exactly what flavor of hat they prefer yet). And with many hats comes an extremely broad base of knowledge and experience. For example, you made a small adjustment in your team’s legacy backend API that a senior engineer owns. I wrote and deployed the whole API after setting up our entire CI/CD pipeline the night before while explaining to a VC that we’re pivoting from DTC to B2B and our MVP is actually a POC. I also hired the senior engineer. We are not the same._

&nbsp;

I love hats! And I made sure my interviewers knew it. I branded myself as the most avaricious hat-wearer there was. But I digress.

Is the best thing for a potential future startup player to just work at startups right now? Well, yes and no. If you want to ace the SAT, the thing that will have the most transfer is to take the SAT. But I’m not about to ask someone who barely has a grasp on 10th grade math to just forget algebra and grind practice tests instead. Now, I consider myself a decent engineer. Above average even (take that with a [grain of salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority) though). However, at least right now, I don’t consider myself knowledgeable enough to take a company from zero to hero in any reasonable amount of time. Sure, given enough time and margin for error to figure things out and break things along the way, I believe I could pull it off.

But that’s the thing about startups. Everything must move quickly and one stupid mistake could derail someone’s job or even the entire company. And in a lot of cases, their most senior engineers are only a couple years ahead of you. So now you need to deliver a mission critical feature on a tight schedule without really knowing what’s going on, and everyone around you is only slightly less confused. Yes, you’ll learn a lot. But it’s trial by fire and not everyone has the technical foundation to succeed with that alone. Sometimes you need to make sure you have solid fundamentals before expecting to be of any use at all, let alone becoming the proverbial rockstar engineer every company craves.

## Contention #4: Impact

_Isn’t that the point though? You have the potential to derail the company because you have so much autonomy and potential to have an outsized impact. Who wouldn’t want that over being an inconsequential cog in an uncaring, unloving machine?_

&nbsp;

This may be true to an extent, but remember that even if you are engineer 1,001 at BigTechCorp, you are still writing code that will directly or indirectly touch the company’s enormous user base. Add to that the fact that you will most likely be working on a fairly small team within BigTechCorp, so the work that you own will still be rather substantial within that context. It’s like being an indie standup comedian doing club shows versus being a cast member on SNL. Sure, the indie comic has complete creative freedom over their material and can get decent turnout to their hour-long show. But the four minute sketch the SNL member played a supporting role in was seen by millions.

So much of this is also team dependent. Some managers just support their engineers better, giving them more substantial assignments and recognizing them for a job well done. You’re not doomed to a life of cog-in-machine syndrome just because you’re not at a startup.

## Contention #5: Network

_That’s well and good, but if you join a startup, you’ll have a killer network including everyone in your team, as well as any investors and advisors you have onboard. A very strong launch board for any ventures you start down the line. Plus, you’ll get super close with your team, for better or for worse. With a group that small and a common goal, you’ll be spending a lot of your time and social energy with your coworkers, who are probably in a similar place in their lives as you._

&nbsp;

Your network coming out of a startup will be invaluable, and it’s hard to get access to a mix of smart engineers, self-starting entrepreneurs and venture capitalists in any other setting. That said, you can also get a different kind of invaluable network at BigTechCorp, and your BigTechCorp network will probably be a lot larger by the fact that it is a big tech corp. You’ll have the benefit of a larger pool of smart and experienced people to tap into. Granted, you’re probably more likely to meet a resting and vesting lifer than a gritty self starter. But that doesn’t mean the self-starters aren’t there.

My first startup experience was at a company founded by two people who got tired of working in big tech and decided to go venturing together. So rest assured that if you find yourself suffering from cog-in-machine syndrome, the company is big enough that you’ll probably meet someone else feeling the same way. Coffee coffee network network, now you have a co-founder for your revolutionary ML cloud blockchain SAAS idea.

## Introspection Time

While this is not real career advice by any means, I hope you were at least able to get something out of this post after reading this far. Like I said at the beginning, I ended up signing on with AWS. I figured the professional development, pedigree and network I would come out of it with were worth more than what I would personally gain from any alternative. Plus, the cool lump of cash I’ll have accumulated will give me plenty of runway if I decide to do something more precarious down the line.

I think my original plan of spending my career playing the startup game is still what I want to do. Spending decades climbing the corporate ladder seems dull, and resting and vesting feels like it would be boring and lifeless. I still want to do something cool, meaningful, impactful, etc. of my own some day. I just think it would be best to take some time to get my bearings and build my base first. I want to have the skills, experience and network that will enable me to jump to whatever new venture strikes my fancy. Of course, I don’t have any real world experience to confirm or deny any of these thoughts. I just took the time to consider a different perspective. Who knows? Maybe I’ll find joy in the structure and stability of corporate living and become a lifer. Maybe corporate life will be entirely insufferable and I’ll instantly regret not going with a startup sooner. Or maybe this really is the best way forward. I can’t say for sure.

I’ve already discussed the practical stuff so I’m allowing myself to wax philosophical a bit here. Throughout my decision-making process, I repeatedly found myself simply trying to minimize regret. Would I regret spending the first few years of my career in relative tedium, having given up on the opportunity to build something cool immediately out of college? Or would I regret sinking those years into a middling project when I could have become a senior engineer at FAANG? Maybe the logic underpinning this entire post is flawed and I’m considering things from a ridiculous angle. Again, can’t say for sure.

I’ll close with a quote that I’ve found to be quite helpful. From [Chris Ballas](https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2009/07/a_surprising_number_of_teens_t.html),

> "The goal of adulthood is to let go of the other possible existences and to make the best of the one. A successful adult is one who understands that it doesn't matter which life you ultimately pick, only that you live it well."
